    "A Decision Tree Classifier is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It's a type of supervised learning algorithm that works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the values of input features, eventually leading to a set of rules that can be used to make predictions about the class labels of new data points.\n",

    "Decision trees have the advantage of being easy to understand and visualize, as they can be represented graphically. However, they can become overly complex and prone to overfitting if not properly controlled. To address this, techniques like pruning and using ensembles of trees (like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting) are often employed.\n",

    "Recursion and Stopping Criteria: Once a feature is chosen for splitting, the dataset is divided into subsets based on the feature's values.

    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification involves envisioning the decision boundaries created by the splits in the feature space. Decision trees partition the feature space into regions, and the class assigned to a region is determined by the majority class of the training samples within that region.\n",

    "Decision trees make binary splits at each node based on a selected feature. These splits are orthogonal (perpendicular) to the axes of the feature space.\n",
    "Each split divides the space into two subspaces. The tree continues to recursively split these subspaces until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "Dividing Feature Space into Rectangles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each level of the tree adds a new split, which divides the current space into smaller rectangles.\n",
    "At the leaf nodes, these rectangles represent the regions of the feature space that are assigned to specific class labels.\n",
    "Decision Boundaries and Class Assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary associated with a split is the boundary line or hyperplane that separates the space into two parts based on the feature's value.\n",
    "The class assigned to a region is determined by the majority class of the training samples falling into that region. For example, if most of the training samples within a region are labeled as Class A, that region will be assigned to Class A.\n",
    "Making Predictions for New Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction for a new data point, you start at the root of the decision tree and traverse down through the splits based on the feature values of the data.\n",
    "At each split, you follow the path that corresponds to the value of the current feature.\n",
    "When you reach a leaf node, the class associated with that leaf node is the predicted class for the new data point.\n",
    "Visualizing Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees can be visualized as a hierarchical structure, where each level represents a split and each leaf node represents a class label.\n",
    "In the feature space, the decision boundaries are represented by the split lines or surfaces, and each region corresponds to a different class prediction.\n",
    "Limitations and Complex Boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees tend to create axis-aligned boundaries, which may not be able to capture complex decision boundaries that require diagonal or curved divisions.\n",
    "However, ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting combine multiple decision trees to create more complex decision boundaries."
